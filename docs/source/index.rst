AccuNGS - accurate sequencing
=============================

AccuNGS (Accurate Next Generation Sequencing) is a sequencing approach that 
maximizes accuracy and yield, while maintaining simplicity for both wet-lab 
protocols and computational analysis. It is extremely useful, for example, 
for sequencing of RNA or DNA virus populations that often maintain varying 
levels of genetic diversity.
